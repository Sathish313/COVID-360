1.Title: COVID-360

2.Description:
The world is fighting with an invisible, deadly enemy, trying to understand and handle the threat posed by the virus. 
The coronavirus family causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases and even leads to death. 
To protect ourselves from this deadly virus, WHO recommends basic hygiene such as sanitizing our hands at regular intervals, usage of mask at public places and Maintaining “social distancing” – keeping at least 1 meter distance, also avoid touching your nose, eyes and mouth with unwashed hands.
In India after 8 months of lockdown people have started to come out for their routine. In this Scenario we need to follow those basic hygiene recommended by WHO.
But unfortunately these things are not followed by most of the people in India. If these circumstances prevail, it will make the situation even worse. To overcome the above issues, 
This project COVID-360° aims at ensuring people safety and to increase the self awareness about sanitizing hand, wearing mask and checking body temperature.

3.HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS.
3.1.Arduino NANO.
Arduino NANO is the brain of the product. It is a small, complete, and breadboard-friendly board that is used to command and control other components of the system. 
It  is programmed using the specific software, Integrated development environment (IDE), which is common to all Arduino boards which operates on both online and offline.
3.2.Motor driver(L298D)
This L298N Motor Driver Module is a high power motor driver module for driving DC and Stepper Motors.
L298N Module can control up to 4 DC motors, or 2 DC motors with directional and speed control.
Driver Voltage: 5-35V
Driver Current:2A
3.3.1000 RPM Motor
A DC motor is defined as a class of electrical motors that convert direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy.
Here this motor is used in mask dispenser. whenever the hand is sensed the automatic mask dispenses to the user.  
3.4.OLED Display
This is used to display the detected temperature in a display.It is connected to arduino.
3.5.MLX90614 IR Thermal Sensor
This sensor is used to check the body temperature. The MLX90614 Thermal sensor used in the product offers a standard accuracy of ± 0.5˚C around room temperatures. This is connected with arduino.
3.6.IR Proximity Sensor
A proximity sensor is a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact. This is connected with arduino.

4.SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS.
The Arduino Integrated Development Environment ( IDE) is a cross-platform application.This is an open source software that is mainly used for writing and compiling the code into the Arduino Module.
Here we are using c++ programming language to automate the covid-360.
